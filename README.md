# i.do - The code-based todo-list
"**i.do**" is a code-based todo-list that focuses on habit building and procedures.

Because sometimes you need an algorithm that works for you, not just a bullet list.

**The plan is:**

- get the app working to automate the task tracking

- get a community to form around this format

- share wisdom and useful algorithms

- create a steady database for all to use

## Example of format

For instance, the below pseudo-code is readable, and anyone can perform it for keeping track of tasks, in a deeper way than simply todo-lists.

The goal is to make an app that automates this process and keeps you on track of your goals.

*"The problem today is not the lack of information, it's the lack of wisdom."*

# Roadmap

## Stage1 - Prototype
### 1. Create the python framework
### 2. Create jupyter notebook prototype that follows simple flow
### 3. Make web interface that accepts i.do lists  
### 4. Make rudimentary control flows
### 5. Decide on a system that knows which "actions" and "tokens" are defined and which are not (and require human input)
### 6. Create action feedback and response, that gets saved for each user.
### 7. Make the flow seamless and easy to use
### 8. Make a MVP, and launch tests.

## Stage2 - Attract the community
### 1. Create social media involvement
### 2. Standardise the format of i.do
### 3. Gather a collection of i.do notes
### 4. Decide on branding and name
### 5. Create & Test & Refine

## Stage3 - Scale the feedback
### 1. Add voting system
### 2. Add local database to store the notes
### 3. Base it all on git
### 4. Create nodes, that people can gather and vote on
